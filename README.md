# rust-lox

A Rust implementation of the Lox language from the (excellent) book "Crafting Interpreters" (https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

---

This contains a complete implementation of both the tree-walking and the bytecode-based interpreters, which share some common parsing logic.

There's a whole lot of Lox implementations out there; there's nothing particularly special about this one, but I wanted to learn more about compilers and interpreters, and I had a lot of fun doing this.
