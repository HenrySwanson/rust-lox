Reading "Crafting Interpreters" (https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and following along in Rust.

I've got a tree-walking interpreter (Chapter 2), and a bytecode based one (Chapter 3).

There's a lot of things beyond the scope of the book I'd like to add, but they're currently sitting in my notes somewhere,
and I'll have to fish them out later.
